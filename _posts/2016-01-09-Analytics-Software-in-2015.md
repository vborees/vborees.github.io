title: Analytics Software in 2015
---

Techcrunch has just released the article on Analytics Software results from the past year. Since this topic belongs to my interests, it is worth to mention the main trends of the past year here.

* Sql on Hadoop. No wonder for me, SQL is taking over the Hadoop. Presto, Impala and Drill will be the keywords of the coming year

* Druid might become the sugnificant player in the OLAP databases world

* Open-Source machile learning libraries are booming! Worth to mention: Tensor Flow, Theano, Torch and DMLT. 

* IBM put efforts to develop the Spark ecosystem, including Spark as a service on Bluemix.

* Open-source BI: not very enthusiastic about it, but we'll see the the further development in 2016.

* Codeless analytics: continious try to aquire not tech-savvy guys to be able to use them.

* Big year for AWS Redshift. Having work with it, i agree it is an extremely powerfull tool. No wonder many startups are centered around data loading and data analysis inside Redshift.

Stay tuned!
